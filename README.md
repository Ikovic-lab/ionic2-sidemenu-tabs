# Ionic 2 Side Menu + Tabs

UPDATED: This branch, at the time of pushing, was using these dependencies. See the `package.json` file for the detailed dependencies.

```
  "dependencies": {
    "@angular/common": "2.0.0",
    .....

    "ionic-angular": "2.0.0-rc.1",
    "ionic-native": "2.2.3",
    ....
  },
```

## What is here?

You'll find 3 **branches** in this repository, each built using a specific version in Ionic 2's development timeline

* **master**: The master branch was the first version of the Ionic 2 side menu tabs. It was released in May 2016, so was based on the state of Ionic 2 at that time. It was written in vanilla Javascript
* **typescript**: Was the typescript version of the **master**, released in August as a result of TypeScript growing on us.
* **2.0-rc.1**: This is the final release candidate for Ionic 2. In this, almost all are stable and ready to rock and roll.

This is the **2.0-rc.1** branch of the Ionic 2 Side Menu Tabs project from Khophi's Dev
